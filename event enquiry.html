            and pay any security deposit required.</li>
            <li>The Music Centre will provide Public Liability Insurance and Volunteer Workers Personal Accident

            <li>The Music Centre will assist with technical specification so that the venue is set up as required.</li>
            <li>The Music Centre will provide a bulk email service, promotion of the event on the TicketShop and

            <li>After the event, the Music Centre will finalise the contracts with the Townsville City Council and

                <li>You will need a repertoire to fill 60 to 90 minutes, arranged and rehearsed so that it flows smoothly.
                Clothing, uniforms or costumes should be appropriate to the style of music..</li>
                <li> Let us know the proposed date of your concert as early as possible, preferably 3 months before the event
                (all the major venues are heavily booked and many theatre bookings are made 2 years ahead!). </li>
                <li>All the information for ticket sales and advertising should be ready 5 weeks before the event. The TicketShop receives many enquiries from members of the public, so as                 soon as the event is listed on their database
                they will require details of the content of the proposed concert along with start time, interval time, finish
                time, ticket prices.</li>
                <li>Technical requirements, e.g. stage layout, sound, lighting, access times, etc, should be determined at least
                <b>3 weeks</b> before the event to allow for rostering of theatre staff.</li>
                <li>Also required is the confidence and commitment to see it through - it <b>costs money to cancel a concert	</b>! If you cancel the concert, the Music Centre may seek to 													           		recover from you expenses already committed plus expenses incurred because of the cancellation.</li>
                <li> To receive <b>payment</b> from the proceeds of your concert, you will be asked to provide an invoice quoting an
                Australian Business Number. If you do not have an ABN, you may be asked to complete a “Statement
                by a Supplier” form to avoid having funds withheld for taxation.</li>

            Commercial advertising is expensive and for a small budget, not very effective.
            All the news media like to publicise community events, but they need to be fed the information.
            Journalists, radio and TV presenters like to find stories of human interest with some connection to the
            local community. <br><br>
            If you can provide about 300 to 500 words about your group, the history of your organisation, individual
            performers, or the content of your concert along with good-quality photos suitable for a newspaper
            article, journalists and editors are more likely to publish a major feature in their editorial pages, which
            will be far more effective than any normal advertising. Photos for this purpose need to be in the original
            camera format, not compressed or reduced in any way. This also applies to photos used on posters. The
            Music Centre can easily produce copies of the photos suitable for websites, Facebook and email. <br><br>
            Given suitable material, the Music Centre can produce professional-standard posters, flyers and email
            templates at minimum cost. However, we do not have the resources to distribute posters around the
            city. <br><br>
            In all of the above imagery, human faces are the key to selling tickets. A poster design which is
            artistically magnificent might win an art award, but if it doesn’t contain an image of the performers, it
            won’t help in selling tickets. <br><br>
            A short text of 150 to 200 words describing the performers and the performance are required for our
            website, the TicketShop website and our bulk email. An even shorter text of less than 50 words is
            required for listing on the Civic Theatre’s calendars and flyers and the Community Information Centre’s
            Arts e-Bulletin. <br><br>
            Television and radio stations also provide free promotion of our events, but they need 2 to 3 weeks’
            notice. ABC Local Radio and 4TTT may offer on-air interviews and sometimes live on-air
            performances.</label>

      <label class="address"><h1><b>Planning your concert:</b></h1><br><br>
            A professionally-managed venue will have a standard configuration, which will typically have a floor plan
            and information about seating, stage, sound, lighting, bar and catering, etc. If you stick to the standard
            configuration you will minimise costs. <br><br>
            If you want to change the configuration you will be responsible for any costs incurred in the change, and
            you will also be responsible for returning the venue to its standard configuration. Some venues will allow
            you to do some of this work; most will charge you for some or all of it. You may also be charged an
            extra fee for any equipment that is not included in the standard hire charge. <br><br>
            Pianos require special consideration, because they are vulnerable to damage when moved or lifted.
            Moving a piano a short distance over a smooth flat floor usually causes no problem, but lifting it onto a
            raised stage requires manpower and/or lifting equipment. Grand pianos are particularly vulnerable. Most
            venues do not permit their grand piano to be lifted and require it to be tuned after any significant
            movement. Once a piano has been moved into position and tuned, it should not be moved again before
            the performance. <br><br>
            The standard hire charge may apply for the whole day, but the venue management may require payment
            for at least one person to be on duty for all the hours that you are actually present. <br><br>
            The compere, stage manager, sound and lighting operators and even the ushers all contribute to the
            success of your show. Please don’t spring any surprises on them. If you want to do something
            unorthodox or “unexpected” then it all needs to be carefully planned and, if possible, rehearsed.</label>
